This package is built on top of the flutter_lints package and contains rules that are more strict.

Lints are surfaced by the dart analyzer, which statically checks dart code. Dart-enabled IDEs typically present the issues identified by the analyzer in their UI. Alternatively, the analyzer can be invoked manually by running flutter analyze.

# Usage

To use these rules, you need to add the following to **dev_dependencies**:

```yaml
flutter_linting_rules:
  git:
    url: https://github.com/el-leonya/flutter_linting_rules.git
```
